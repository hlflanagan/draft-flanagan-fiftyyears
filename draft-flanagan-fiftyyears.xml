<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction"> <t>The Series is not the
IETF, nor the IAB, nor the IRTF. The purpose and goals are not the same, though
they are often well aligned. The goal of the Series is to provide a solid,
stable reference point for information and protocols about the Internet. Anyone
should be able to access the documents, and anyone can submit a document (modulo
going through one of several no-cost-to-publish processes to do so). </t>

<t>Since the very first RFC fifty years ago, the focus of the Series has been on
that stable record and dissemination of ideas to the world. At times there have
been conflicts over what is more important - a stable, archival record, or
making the latest ideas available as soon as possible. As the Internet has
evolved, so to has the expectation of instant access, faster changes, and
ubiquitous availability. It seems that the need for a stable reference point is
often deprioritized against those more immediate needs. </t>

<t>Change does come to the Series, albeit slowly. First, we saw the distribution
method change from postal mail to FTP and email. From there, we saw increased
guidance for authors on how to write an RFC. The editorial staff went from one
person to a team of five to seven. The actual editing and publishing arm split
from the protocol registration service. The whole RFC Editor structure was
reviewed and refined <xref target="RFC6635"/>. And, in the last few years, we've
started to the process to change the format of the RFC documents themselves.
This is evolution, and the need to change to meet the needs and expectations of
the world will continue, and will be balanced against the core mission of
maintaining a strong, stable, archival record of what has been published.</t>

<t>In this document, several individuals who have been a part of shaping the
Series offer their observations of key moments in the series. Steve Crocker,
author of RFC 1, offers his thoughts on how and why the Series began. Leslie
Daigle, a major influence in the development of the RFC Editor model, offers her
thoughts on the change of the RFC Editor to a stronger, contracted function.
Nevil Brownlee, Independent Submissions Editor from 20xx through February 2018,
shares his view on the clarification of the IS and its transition from Bob
Braden. As the current RFC Series Editor, I will put my thoughts in on the most
recent changes in formalizing the digital preservation of the Series, the
process to modernize the format while respecting the need for stability, and my
thoughts on the next fifty years of RFCs.</t>

<section anchor="the-origins-of-rfcs-by-stephen-d-crocker" title="The Origins of
RFCs - by Stephen D.  Crocker">

<t>[This is a revision of material included in <xref target="RFC1000"/> August
1987, more than thirty years ago.]</t>

<t>The Internet community now includes millions of nodes and billions of users,
but once it was all a gleam in Bob Taylor's and Larry Roberts' eyes.  While much
of the development proceeded according to a grand plan, the design of the
protocols and the creation of the RFCs was largely accidental.</t>

<t>The procurement of the ARPANET was initiated in the summer of 1968 - Remember
Vietnam, flower children, etc? There had been prior experiments at various ARPA
sites to link together computer systems, but this was the first version to
explore packet-switching on a grand scale.  ("ARPA" didn't become "DARPA" until
1972.  It changed back to ARPA and then back again to DARPA several years
later.)   The government's RFQ (Request for Quote) called for four Interface
Message Processors ("IMPs") to be delivered to four sites in the western part of
the United States: UCLA in Los Angeles, CA; SRI International in Menlo Park, CA;
University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Utah in Salt Lake
City.  These sites were running a Scientific Data Systems (SDS) Sigma 7, an SDS
940, an IBM 360/75, and a DEC PDP-10.  These machines not only had their own
operating systems, even details like character sets and byte sizes varied.  The
Quote specified there would be additional nodes if the first experiments were
successful, and we knew these sites would have further variations.</t>

<t>The precise usage of the ARPANET was not spelled out in advance, and the
research community could be counted on to take some initiative.  To stimulate
this process, a meeting was called in August 1968 with representatives from the
selected sites, chaired by Elmer Shapiro from SRI.  Shapiro's notes from that
meeting list J. Hopper and Jeff Rulifson from SRI, Glen Culler and G. Buck from
Santa Barbara, R. Stephenson, C. Stephen Carr and W. Boam from Utah, and Vint
Cerf and me from UCLA.  A few others from potential future sites also
attended.</t>

<t>That first meeting was seminal.  We had lots of questions - how IMPs and
"hosts" (I think that was the first time I was first exposed to that term) would
be connected?  What hosts would say to each other?  What applications would be
supported?  The only concrete answers were remote login and file transfer, but
we knew the vision had to be larger.  We found ourselves imagining all kinds of
possibilities - interactive graphics, cooperating processes, automatic data base
query, electronic mail - but no one knew where to begin.  We weren't sure
whether there was really room to think hard about these problems; surely someone
from the east would be along by and by to bring the word.  But we did come to
one conclusion: We ought to meet again.  Over the next several months, we met at
each of our sites, thereby setting the precedent for regular face to face
meetings.  We also instantly felt the irony.  This new network was supposed to
make it possible to work together at a distance, and the first thing we did was
schedule a significant amount of travel.</t>

<t>In short order a small, fairly consistent set of graduate students and staff
members from the first four sites met over the next several months.  We adopted
the term Network Working Group (NWG) to designate ourselves.  This was the same
term Elmer Shapiro had used when he convened our first meeting, and it had been
used until that point to refer to the principal investigators and ARPA personnel
senior people who had been planning the network.  Our group was junior and
disjoint from the prior group, except, of course, that each of us worked for one
of the principal investigators.</t>

<t>The first few meetings were quite tenuous.  We had no official charter or
leadership, and it was not clear, at least to me, whether someone or some group
would show up with the official authority and responsibility to take over the
problems we were dealing with.  Without clear definition of what the host-IMP
interface would look like, or even a precise definition of what functions the
IMP would provide, we focused on broader ideas.  We envisioned the possibility
of application specific protocols, with code downloaded to user sites, and we
took a crack at designing a language to support this.  The first version was
known as DEL, for "Decode-Encode Language" and a later version was called NIL,
for "Network Interchange Language.""</t>

<t>In late 1968 Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) in Cambridge, MA won the contract
for the IMPs and began work in January 1969.  A few of us flew to Boston in the
middle of February to meet the BBN crew.  The BBN folks, led by Frank Heart, Bob
Kahn, Severo Ornstein, Ben Barker, Will Crowther and Dave Walden, were
organized, professional and focused.  Their first concern was how to meet their
contract schedule of delivering the first IMP to UCLA at the beginning of
September and how to get bits to flow quickly and reliably.  The details of the
host-IMP were not yet firm; the specification came a few months later.  They
didn�t take over the protocol design process, nor did any other source of
authority appear.  We doggedly pushed forward.</t>

<t>A month later our small NWG met in Utah.  As the meeting came toward an end,
it became clear to us that we should start writing down our discussions.  We had
accumulated a few notes on the design of DEL and other matters, and we decided
to put them together in a set of notes.  We assigned writing chores to each of
us, and I took on the additional task of organizing the notes.  I suppose I was
the first RFC Editor, though I never use that term because we never reviewed or
changed the content of any of the RFCs.  The only rule I imposed was the note
had to be complete before I assigned a number because I wanted to minimize the
number of holes in the sequence.</t>

<t>I tried a couple of times to write a note on how the notes would be
organized, but I found myself full of trepidation.  Would these notes look as if
we were asserting authority we didn't have?  Would we unintentionally offend
whomever the official protocol designers were?  Finally, unable to sleep, I
wrote the a few humble words.  The basic ground rules were that anyone could say
anything and that nothing was official.  And to emphasize the point, I used Bill
Duvall's suggestion and labeled the notes "Request for Comments." I never
dreamed these notes would eventually be distributed through the very medium we
were discussing in these notes.  Talk about Sorcerer�s Apprentice!</t>

<t>After BBN published the specification for the hardware and software interface
to the IMPs our attention shifted to low-level matters.  The ambitious ideas for
automatic downloading of code evaporated.  It would be several years before
ideas like remote procedure calls, ActiveX, JAVA and RESTful interfaces
appeared.</t>

<t>Over the spring and summer of that year we grappled with the detailed
problems of protocol design.  Although we had a vision of the vast potential for
intercomputer communication, designing usable protocols was another matter. We
knew a custom hardware interface and a custom software addition in the operating
system was going to be required for anything we designed, and we anticipated
these would pose some difficulty at each of the sites.  We looked for existing
abstractions to use.  It would have been convenient if we could have made the
network simply look like regular device, e.g., a tape drive, but we knew that
wouldn�t do.  The essence of this network was cooperation among the machines,
not master-slave relationships.  We settled on a virtual bit stream as the basic
building block for the protocols, but even back then we knew that some
applications like voice might need to avoid that layer of software.</t>

<t>Over the next two years, ideas were developed, exchanged, and implemented.  I
took a leave from UCLA in June 1971 to spend time working at ARPA.  Jon Postel
took over the care and feeding of the RFCs, evolving the process over the next
twenty seven years.</t>

<t>The rapid growth of the network and the working group also led to a large
pile of RFCs.  When the 100th RFC was in sight, Peggy Karp at MITRE took on the
task of indexing them.  That seemed like a large task then, and we could have
hardly anticipated seeing more than a 1000 RFCs several years later, and the
evolution toward Internet Drafts yet later.</t>

<t>When we first started working on the protocols, the network did not exist.
Except for our occasional face to face meetings, RFCs were our only means of
communication.  In <xref target="RFC0003"/> I set the bar as low as
possible:</t>

<t><list style='empty'> <t>The content of a NWG note may be any thought,
suggestion, etc.  related to the HOST software or other aspect of the
network.<vspace /> Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than
polished.<vspace /> Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics,
specific suggestions or implementation techniques without  introductory or
background explication, and explicit questions  without any attempted answers
are all acceptable.  The minimum  length for a NWG note is one sentence.</t>
</list></t>

<t>These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto
authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of
considerably less than authoritative ideas.  Second, there is a natural
hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this
inhibition.</t>

<t>Making the RFCs informal was not only a way of encouraging participation, it
was also important in making the communication effective.  One of the early
participants said he was having trouble writing and sending an RFC because his
institution wanted to subject them to publication review.  These are not
"publications," I declared, and the problem went away.  Another small detail,
handled instinctively and without debate was the distribution model.  Each
institution was required to send a copy directly to each of the other
institutions.  Each institution handled internal copies and distribution itself.
Submission to a central point for redistribution was not required, so we
minimized the delays.  SRI's Network Information Center, however, did maintain a
central repository of everything and provided an invaluable record.</t>

<t>We didn't intentionally set out to challenge the existing standards
organizations, but our natural mode of operation yielded some striking results.
The RFCs are open in two important respects: anyone can write one for free and
anyone get them for free.  At the time, virtually everyone in the Arpanet
community was sponsored by the government, so there was little competition and
no need to use documents as a way of raising money.  The effect of this openness
is often overlooked.  Students and young professionals all over the world
download the RFCs and build the most amazing software.</t>

<t>Where will it end? The network has the exceeded all estimates of its growth.
It has been transformed, extended, cloned, renamed and reimplemented.  All of
the computers have changed, as have all of the transmission lines.  But the RFCs
march on.  Maybe I'll write a few words for RFC 10,000.</t>

<t>Quite obviously the circumstances have changed.  Email is ubiquitous for the
immediate exchange of inchoate thoughts.  Internet Drafts are the means for
exchanging substantial drafts.  And RFCs are reserved for fully polished,
reviewed, edited and approved protocols.  Comments to RFCs are no longer
requested.  Rather than bemoan the change, I take it as a remarkable example of
adaptation.  RFCs continue to serve the protocol development community.  Indeed,
they are the bedrock of a very vibrant, productive and process that has fueled
and guided the Internet revolution.</t>

</section> <section anchor="formalizing-the-rfc-editor-model-leslie-daigle"
title="Formalizing the RFC Editor Model - Leslie Daigle"> <t>I was the chair of
the Internet Architecture Board, the board responsible for the general oversight
of the RFC Series, at a particular inflection point in the evolution of all
Internet technology institutions. To understand what we did, and why we had to,
let me first paint a broader picture of the arc of these institutions.</t>

<t>Like many others who were in decision-making roles in the mid -00's, I wasn't
present when the Internet was born. The lore passed down to me was that, out of
the group of talented researchers that developed the core specifications and
established the direction of the Internet, different individuals stepped up to
take on roles necessary to keep the process of specification development
organized and open. As the work of specification expanded, those individuals
were generally supported by organizations that carried on in the same spirit.
This was mostly Jon Postel, doing the work of names and numbers, as well as
working as the editor of RFCs, but there were also individuals and institutions
supporting the IETF's Secretariat function. By the late 20th century, even this
model was wearing thin - the support functions were growing, and organizations
didn't have the ability to donate even more resources to run them. In some cases
(IANA) there was significant industry and international dependence on the
function and its neutrality.</t>

<t>The IETF, too, had grown in size, stature, and commercial reliance. This
system of institutional pieces "flying in formation" was not providing the kind
of contractual regularity or integrated development that the IETF needed. People
who hadn't been there as the institutions developed, including IETF
decision-makers, didn�t innately understand why things "had to be the way they
were", and were frustrated when trying to get individual systems updated for new
requirements, and better integrated across the spectrum of activities.</t>

<t>Internet engineering had expanded beyond the point of being supportable by a
loosely-coupled set of organizations of people who had been there since the
beginning and knew each other well. New forms of governance and were needed, as
well as rationalized funding The IANA function was absorbed into a purpose-built
international not-for-profit organization. The IETF stepped up to manage its own
organizational destiny (IASA), and the Secretariat became one of its contracted
functions.</t>

<t>This left the RFC Editor function as an ISOC-supported, independent
effort.</t>

<t>That independence of nature was necessary for the historic role of the RFC
Series in considering all technical contributions. But, at that inflection point
in the Series� history, it needed a new governance and funding model, just as
the other Internet technical specification supporting organizations had. Also,
the IETF leadership had some concerns it felt it needed to be addressed in its
own technical publication sream. While the RFC Series had been established
before there was an IETF, and had historically continued to have documents in it
that didn�t originate from the IETF, the IETF was its largest and most organized
contributor. There was no particular organization of independent contributors.
Equally, the funding for the RFC Editor was at that point coming from the
Internet Society in the guise of "support for the IETF". For people who hadn't
been involved with the institution from the outset, it was pretty easy to
perceive the RFC Series uniquely as the IETF's publication series. So, the
challenge was to identify and address the IETF's issues, along with governance
and funding, without sacrificing the fundamental nature of the RFC Series as a
broader-than-IETF publication series.</t>

<t>To give a sense of the kinds of tensions that were prevalent, let me share
that the one phrase that sticks in my mind from those discussions is: "push to
publish". There were those in IETF leadership who felt that it would
significantly reduce costs and improve timeliness if an RFC could be published
by, literally, pushing a button on a web interface the moment it was approved by
the IESG. It would also, they argued, remove the specification issues being
introduced by copy-editors that were hired as occasional workers to help with
improving publication rates, but who weren�t necessarily up to speed on terms of
art in technical specifications. (There were some pretty egregious examples that
I forebear from citing here; let's just say it wasn't strictly a problem of
Internet engineers getting uptight about their cheese being moved). While "push
to publish" would have addressed those issues, it would not have addressed the
loss of clarity from the many significant text improvements copy editors
successfully introduced, or the fact that not all RFCs are approved by the
IESG.</t>

<t>Institutionally, it was clear that the target was to have the RFC Editor
function governance within the reach of the Internet technical community (as
opposed to any particular private organization), without tying it specifically
to the IETF. That was reasonably achievable by ensuring that the resultant
pieces were established under the oversight of the IAB (which is, itself,
independent of the IETF, even as it is supported by the IASA organization).</t>

<t>The IETF worked on a document outlining functional requirements for its
technical specification publication. This could have been useful for
establishing its own series, but it also was helpful in establishing awareness
of the challenges in document publishing (it always looks easy when you haven�t
thought about it), and also to lay the ground work for dialogue with the RFC
Editor. The requirements document was published as <xref target="RFC4714"/>, as an Informational
RFC that stands today to provide guidance in the editing processes surrounding
IETF publications.</t>

<t>There was still, however, a certain lack of clarity about responsibilities
for making decisions and changes in the RFC Series itself. To that end, I and
the IAB worked with the various involved parties to produce <xref
target="RFC4744"/>. That document captured the RFC Series mission (for a purpose
greater than IETF technical specification publication), as well as the roles and
responsibilities of the parties involved. The RFC Editor has responsibility for
ensuring the implementation of the mission. The IAB continues to have oversight
responsibilities, including policy oversight, which it could act on by changing
the person (organization) in the role of RFC Editor. At the same time,
operational oversight was migrated to the IASA support function of the IETF (and
IAB).</t>

<t>The discussions, and the resulting publication of RFC 4744, allowed greater
visibility into and commitment to the RFC Series, as a general Internet
publication. It also meant that subsequent adjustments could be made, as
requirements evolved � the responsible parties are clearly identified. </t>

<t>As Steve Crocker mentioned, the Series began with a goal of communication
over formality, openness over structure. As the Internet has grown and become a
pervasive, global construct, we still aim for openness and communication, but
recognize that for protocols and other information to support interoperability,
there must be points of stability to build from. Small-time app developers to
multi-billion dollar companies are on the same footing. And anyone can look back
at a point in time and understand what was done, and why.</t>

<t>While the informality has given way to increased structure, the openness and
solid foundation that the Series provides must continue. With that in mind,
what is next for the next fifty years of RFCs?</t>
